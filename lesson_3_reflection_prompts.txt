That you avoid remote mergint at all.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I'd collaborate using a network directory, but reviewing the changes would be hader than with github.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I'd want to make changes in a separate branch specially when i want to collaborate with other people. This helps me to grown as a pa proffesional, making collaborative jobs, participating in open source projects, etc.
